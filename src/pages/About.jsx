        Our team participated in the{" "}
        <Highlight style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>2025 Data Dive for Development Hackathon</Highlight>{" "}
        and was selected as one of the two{" "}
        <Highlight style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Winner teams.</Highlight>
      </A.Det_70>
      <A.Det_40>
        Following the competition, we conducted an{" "}
        <Highlight style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>
          8-week development phase
        </Highlight>{" "}
        supported by UNDP,
        <br />
        deepening our analytical approach and building a functional prototype
        that connects data insights
        <br />
        to realistic development decisions.

      <A.Semi>About Our Work</A.Semi>
      <A.Det_70>
        Our project focuses on analyzing{" "}
        <strong>ODA (Official Development Assistance) effectiveness</strong> and
        <br />
        identifying the conditions under which ODA investments most strongly
        contribute to development
        <br />
        outcomes—especially those related to{" "}
        <strong>life expectancy improvement.</strong>
      </A.Det_70>
      <A.Det_70>
        At the beginning of the project, we worked on structuring extensive raw
        ODA datasets and identifying
        <br />
        patterns across countries, sectors, and performance indicators. We
        refined key research questions and
        <br />
        explored pathways to produce meaningful insight for development
        strategy.
      </A.Det_70>
      <A.Det_70>
        During the mid-phase, we divided internal roles and worked in parallel
        across <strong>data analytics, story</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>development, and visualization design.</strong> We investigated
        relationships among performance indicators
        <br />
        and assessed when and where ODA investment delivers greater impact,
        using both qualitative
        <br />
        reasoning and quantitative evidence.
      </A.Det_70>
      <A.Det_70>
        In the final phase, we designed a{" "}
        <strong>visual dashboard and interactive simulation tool,</strong>{" "}
        integrating
        <br />
        analysis results to form a coherent narrative. Through internal reviews
        and external feedback loops,
        <br />
        we strengthened completeness and usability.
      </A.Det_70>

      <A.Det_99>
        Throughout the project period, we continuously managed :

      <A.B1>
        We also engaged in iterative discussions{" "}
        <strong>with UNDP experts</strong>, applying professional guidance
        directly
        <br />
        into model refinement and result interpretation.

      <A.B2>
        Our work demonstrates not only technical capability but also effective
        teamwork and problem-solving,
        <br />
        completing the project with real-world application value.
